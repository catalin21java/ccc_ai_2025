Level 3: The Hurracurra Bird
My lovely species "Hurracurra Bird", it is the
most awesome species, prefers to eat the
“Hurracurra Worm”.
Those worms can only be found in hot regions. I
love those worms because they grow up to a
length of 60 centimeters. Incredible!
And the worm don’t have eyes, but they can
sense light, vibrations, and chemicals in their
environment, helping them avoid danger and
find food. Ah.. What was the question?

Medieval Bluetits fly
back along the same
route they came as
they can't remember
much.

Ah.. Yes.. The Flanking Blackfinch..
Like the Earth around the sun,
flocks of these special birds orbit a
chosen land. They always try to
stay together because they are
crazy about each other!

After spending a wonderful journey
together, the Rusty Goldhammers feel
a need for some "me-time" and split
up for their way back.

The Red Firefinches love and nest
together in their main breeding area.
Occasionally, each of them goes off to
experience their own adventures.

The Sticky Wolfthroats are birds of
prey and eat the Medieval Bluetits
because their routes are easy to
predict. They operate in independent
groups and lie in wait along several
segments of the Bluetits’ routes.





• Some birds are chipped, and BOPs can recognize if they are close
• You have records of BOP travelling paths of individual birds (rows)
• Each bird belongs to exactly one of 6 flocks
• Each flock is one of the 6 species
CSV Sample (included in level_3.zip):
Flock ID, BOP Path
1, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
2, 1 2 5 4 1
note: The spaces after commas in this csv sample are just for readability, they are not in real *.in files
• Each of the 6 species is represented by exactly one flock in each
dataset (e.g. “level_3_a.in” contains all 6 species and exactly 6
flocks)
• You might reuse temperature data from level 1 (included in
level_3.zip, but beware of the °F-bug)
