Level 1: The Bird Observation Points
• The birds are migrating, usually during winter, to escape the cold
temperatures and to find more food in warmer regions.
• Bird feathers are very susceptible to high humidity. For areas with
the same temperature, birds prefer lower humidity.
CSV Sample (included in level_1.zip):
BOP, Temperature [°C], Humidity [%]
1, 20, 15
2, 24, 15
3, 24, 15
4, 20, 10
note: the spaces after commas in this csv sample are just for readability, they are not in real *.in files
Can you please sort the list of BOPs from most to least popular? In the
case of a tie, the lower BOP id should be listed first.
