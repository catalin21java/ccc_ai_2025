Level 2: The Bird Love Score
• You created a new table with all the new values.
• You might reuse data from level 1 (included in level_2.zip)
• Unfortunately, you cannot find the Bird Love Scores for all your Bird
Observation Points. Some are missing.
• Luckily, as you are main class Ornithologist and sub class Data Scientist,
you are confident to find a way to predict the missing values.
• Also, you figured out that some °C temperature values were mistakenly
reported in °F, so you should correct that in your data
CSV Sample (included in level_2.zip):
BOP, Vegetation [%], Insects [g/m²], Urban Light [%], Bird Love Score [<3]
1, 42.07, 10.81, 40.83, 52.44
2, 53.33, 10.32, 39.86, 68.62
3, 57.13, 12.97, 10.11, missing
4, 59.45, 12.30, 67.18, missing
note: the spaces after commas in this csv sample are just for readability, they are not in real *.in files

Level 2: Acceptance Criteria
For this level to succeed, upload a csv file, containing
the predictions for all “missing” Bird Love Scores.
Submission sample (included in level_2.zip):
BOP,Bird Love Score [<3]
