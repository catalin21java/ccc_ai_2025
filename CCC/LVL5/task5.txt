Level 5: A Chirp Disaster
Your classifications were extraordinary – great job!
2 years have passed and lots of data has been recorded with
your fundamental work.
But … a very bad thing happened … Sir Chirp Alot …
he joined an organized gang of poachers.
They hunt migratory birds—it's terrible! You must stop them!

Sir Chirp Alot
Level 5: A Chirp Disaster
All your ornithology friends committed to help you. Fantastic!
Together, you are coming up with a solid plan. Sir Chirp Alot
knows the movement patterns of birds very well. He knows
exactly when and at which BOPs (Bird Observation Points) how
many birds are expected to arrive. He will definitely be at one of
those BOPs with a high bird arrival count—and those are exactly
the BOPs where we want to lie in wait for him. In other words,
we gonna hunt the hunter.

Level 5: A Chirp Disaster
• You have records of BOP information for the last 2 years, which makes 730 days with
2500 BOPs per day for training
• Occupancy = the current bird count at the BOPs
• Arrivals = how many birds are arriving from other BOPs
• You have a weather and insects forecast, but no Arrivals count for the next 30 days (Day
731 to Day 760)
• You might reuse path data from level 4 (included in level_5.zip)
CSV Data:
Day, BOP, Arrivals, Occupancy, Wind X [m/s],
Wind Y [m/s], Insects Delta [g/m²]

Level 5: Acceptance Criteria
To set up the trap for Sir Chirp Alot, we need to predict the top 50
BOPs with the highest Arrivals counts for the next 30 days (Day 731 to
Day 760).
Submission sample (included in level_5.zip):
Day,Top 50 Arrivals BOPs
731,2468 108 2165 ...
...
760,2468 108 2165 ...
 your guesses of 50 BOPs
with the highest Arrivals
counts, for 30 days
The csv sample (included in level_5.zip) is a showcase for the submission format.
We have 30 days to catch him, so the required average accuracy per
day is 50%. This should be sufficient to find Sir Chirp Alot.
